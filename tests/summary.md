  üéØ Iteration 2 Highlights (Dashboard & Navigation)

  test_student_dashboard.py:
  - Dashboard page loading and structure
  - All 4 stat rings verification (Points, Badges, Streak, Courses)
  - My Courses section with empty state handling
  - Achievements/badges section with modal interaction
  - Promotional sections and navigation
  - Course card display verification
  - API data loading validation
  - Access control tests

  test_course_catalog.py:
  - Course catalog page loading with search and filters
  - Search by keyword functionality
  - Category filtering (dynamic categories from data)
  - Difficulty filtering (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
  - Combined search + filter scenarios
  - Course card structure and information display
  - Course detail dialog (modal) interactions
  - Close dialog functionality
  - Empty state for no matches
  - Navigation to full course pages
  - Public/protected access testing

  üéØ Iteration 3 Highlights (Course Interaction)

  test_course_detail.py:
  - Course detail page loading via catalog navigation
  - All course information sections (title, subtitle, description, instructor, dates)
  - Difficulty and category badges
  - Prerequisites display (when present)
  - Course Outline with modules and lessons
  - Lesson navigation (click to navigate to lesson page)
  - Quiz Available badges for lessons with quizzes
  - Enrollment flow for recommended courses (confirmation dialog ‚Üí success dialog)
  - Access control for unauthenticated users

  test_course_quiz.py:
  - Quiz page structure and navigation (documented with skip markers)
  - Question display (numbered, with text)
  - Single-choice questions (RadioGroup from Headless UI)
  - Multiple-choice questions (Checkbox components)
  - Submit button state (disabled until all answered)
  - Quiz submission and results display
  - Score display with pass/fail indicator
  - Correct answers listing
  - Retake quiz functionality
  - Back to course navigation
  - Complete end-to-end quiz workflow
  - Access control tests
  - Note: Quiz tests require test data setup (enrolled course with quiz) and are implemented with pytest.skip() markers for documentation

  üîë Key Features

  Robust Locator Strategy:
  - All locators documented with source code line references
  - Priority: ID > Name > CSS > XPath with text
  - Fallback strategies for brittle selectors
  - Extensive inline documentation

  Comprehensive Assertions:
  - URL verification
  - Element visibility checks
  - Text content validation
  - API data loading verification
  - State management checks (localStorage, session state)

  Well-Organized Structure:
  - Clear test class organization
  - Descriptive test names
  - Comprehensive docstrings
  - Code comments with source references
  - Markers for categorization (smoke, slow, auth)

  Test Isolation:
  - Fresh browser instances per test
  - clear_local_storage fixture
  - Pre-authenticated fixtures for efficiency
  - Independent test execution

  ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Considerations

  1. Password Toggle Button (test_login.py, test_register.py)
    - No unique ID - uses XPath relative to password input
    - May need manual verification if DOM structure changes
  2. Quiz Tests (test_course_quiz.py)
    - Require proper test data (enrolled course with quiz)
    - Currently use pytest.skip() with full implementation
    - Can be executed once test data is available
    - Complete documentation provided for reference
  3. Dynamic Course Navigation
    - Tests navigate through catalog to find courses dynamically
    - Adapts to available course data
    - Some tests skip gracefully if data not present

  üöÄ Running the Complete Test Suite

  # Setup (first time)
  cd tests
